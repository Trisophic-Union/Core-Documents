# Notes

This constitution only applies within the Trisophic Union.

We are working with a Trigonocracy Model running at the Municipal level (with exceptions) with Supranational powers outlined in the document.

Anyone can modify it, its not like its completely offical yet.


I need help in goals lol - Cyborgnetical




Lets improve upon the founding fathers work




# Programs

## Extra Notes
Development shall be delegated to both executive branch and custodium (partially) along with being monitored by the mediacative. Custodium are mandated to intervene if executive is found to be using programs inadecuetly.

## Project Cybersyn
A revival of project Cybersyn is being worked on, albeit its going to be a long time before its operational. Here are the main compotents
- Operations Interface (Live data display)
- Cybernet (Network of computers collecting and processing data)
- CHECO (Chelian Economic simulator) NOTE: Name to be changed
- Cyberstride (Software and Programs Running, along with the infrastructure to maintain them)
- Cyberfolk (Anonimous Rating and alert system for citizens)


## Project Algocracy
Along side our own Project Algocracy is being created, (Technical Political Simulator).

I admit in its current state its a mess. 


Upon completion it shall aid in the custodium to simulate the constituion as a logical program to prevent manipulation of logic and catch corruption. Alongside enforcement where the custodium usually fails.
It shall also serve as to handle administrative tasks of the Union when possible to prevent as much bearucracy as possible.




# Measures

Measures are temporary and consist of three parts:

- The situation for the measure
- The measure itself 
- Conditions to remove the measure.

The situation must be resolved to remove the measure along with any additonal conditions required.

Measure 0:
- The Union doesn't have enough members to function properly, and is still organizing
- Cyborgnetical (The Exectuve), has complete control over the union, it his duty to appoint people to roles to get each branch functional.
- Conditions:
  - Power is changed to an advisory from spesific internal structures once they are working. (Mediatorium, Media Delegation, Penecium, etc)
  - Advisory role is completely removed once the specified branch is fully functional. (Executive, Legislative, Judical, Monocative, Mediacative)
  
  - Current Advisory:
    - Parliment
    - Mediatorium
    - Executive
  - Fully Functional:
    - (None)

Measure 1: 
- Union is still organizing, everyone who is part of the union has clear communications with eachother.

# Definitions

## Subject Election Principal

Elections where voters choose policy statements (subjects) rather than individual candidates; candidates receive support based on how well their proposed statements align with voters' choices.

### Proposals

Candidates propose subjects and issues (items) which they deem most important to be address.

All items are then collected without duplicates

Candidates register and select others items which they do or do not support.


In the end, the average of the items 

### Elections

#### First Election Month

1. Members review a list of items
2. Memebers vote to agree, disagree, or stay neutral on a subject
3. All items are assignd a weight by the following equation


( V ) = Total number of voters
( A_i ) = Number of voters who agree with item ( i )
( D_i ) = Number of voters who disagree with item ( i )
( N_i ) = Number of neutral votes for item ( i )
( w_i ) = Weight Value

[ W_i = \frac{A_i - D_i}{V} ]

The end result should be between 0 and 1, if any result is under 0 then the weight is assinged a value of 0.

4. Average of all weights for each candidate is calculated.

aW_i = The sum of all weight values of each opinion proposed by each candidate.
nW_i = Amount of opinions propsed

[ aW_i / nW_i]


#### Second Election Month

Second Election Month is to happen 1 year later.

1. Members are only allowed to vote for the candidates whos ideas they supported.
2. Same procedure follows as the first election month, only this time they are voting weather each idea was completed by each candidate.
3. Same idea is voted on, but for different candidates and how much they completed.
4. Any candidate reciving a score below 3 is prohibited from rerunning.
  - Candidates are allowed to challenge this in the Judical
  - This ban is only for 4 years.

## Single Transferable Vote (STV)

A form of ranked elections
Each member ranks all candiate from first to last.
Each candiate with or above the panel size divided by the number of seats is automatically elected.
The remaining surplus of votes is reallocated to the rest of the candiates based on each voters next rank preference.
The candiate with the lowest votes will have their votes reallocated to the rest of the candiates based on each voters next rank preference.

If the remaining amount of candiates is equal to the panel size then the remaining candiates are elected to the panel.
If the panel is full then vote reallocation is ended.

## Mediacative



### Rules

These rules apply to the mediatorium.

#### Prohibition of war propaganda. 
In 2001, Anne Morelli systematized the essential war propaganda techniques of Arthur
Ponsonby, who discussed the propaganda approaches to enhance readiness for war (Morelli, 2001; Ponsonby, 1928).
One objective of the mediacative is to prevent, identify, and prosecute these ten techniques of war propaganda:
• “We do not war.”
• “The opposite party alone is guilty for war.”
• “The enemy is inherently evil and resembles the devil.”
• “We defend a noble cause, not our own interests.”
• “The enemy commits atrocities on purpose; our mishaps are involuntary.”
• “The enemy uses forbidden weapons.”
• “We suffer small losses, those of the enemy are enormous.”
• “Recognized artists and intellectuals back our cause.”
• “Our cause is sacred.”
• “All who doubt our propaganda are traitors.”

***Prohibition of emotional coverage of politically relevant subjects.***

Political decision-making must be grounded on logical thinking, facts, and respectful discussion. Emotional mobilization of people contradicts these requirements. There-
fore, reporting must be objective and free of emotional accentuation.

***Requirement of the use of unmistakable, non-suggestive, and neutral wording**.*

In addition to the latter objective, the
information needs to be formulated in clear and neutral speech, without suggestive intrusion of ideas. Thereby, the
public’s opinion can evolve without manipulation.

***Requirement of transparency of coverage***.

For all information delivered, their source and acquisition are to be reported
as well. It is to be guaranteed that their origins are verifiable.

***Requirement of the independent perspective principle.***

To prevent usage of substantive focus and one-sided reporting,
for situations with far-reaching consequences, three perspectives need to be communicated.

***Prohibition of distortion of facts, statistical context distortion, or usage of deepfake media.***

Statistics are often used to convince the public to develop a particular opinion. Albeit the educational system of the trigonocratic system should
minimize the danger of manipulation, the reporting must provide crucial information about the background of statistical
values and the reported content in general.

***Prohibition of proliferation of fake or incomplete news.***

On the one hand, distribution of fake news and context-less
information in social media is to be prohibited. On the other hand, however, media institutions themselves are obligated only to spread confirmed and context-based information.

***Prohibition of discrimination or discreditation of individuals or groups.***

Often, some people or groups of people are
unofficially declared to be disagreeable. However, the only institution to decide upon someone’s guilt is the jurisdiction.
Before and besides eventual judgements, people are to be treated with respect. Even reports about convicted criminals
must be as neutral as possible. Hereby, scapegoating is to be prevented.

***Prohibition of defamation and undermining of presumption of innocence.***

In addition to the convention before, media is
prohibited to imply that a person (or institution) is to be regarded as guilty, although it is only accused. Until the jurisdiction decides upon the final judgement, the principle in dubio pro reo must be respected. However, if there are justified
doubts about the innocence after the judgement, it can be communicated, but solely on a reasonable basis rather than
defamation-like presumptions.

***Prohibition of capitalization of panic or public emotions.***

It is inevitable that, especially in times of crises, the public is
prone to turmoil and panic. Humans were and are emotional beings, thus emotional debates will take place in future as
well. However, the heating up and capitalization of panic and emotions is to be forbidden, as it constitutes an intervention
into the natural behavior of societies.

***Permission and support of independent, investigative journalism.***

Albeit the institutional power of the media can mobilize large numbers of contingents, proactive investigations have the advantage of flexibility and leads to discoveries of crimes. Therefore, independent investigations are to be permitted and, if necessary, supported and protected

### Structure

2. Answer to the Mediatorium when required.
3. Take into account the Mediatorium's Reports, 
4. Register on project CyberFolk (Part of Project Cybersyn) upon completion. (To be defined)





















## Monecative

<!-- Extra note from cyborgnetical--->

<!-- Future plans to intergrate project Cybersyn into this--->

Similarly to the mediacative, the monecative constitutes a novel power of state. It represents the basis for institutions, overseeing the finances of the state, independent from the legislative and executive. However, the trigonocratic principle constitutes a central aspect of its architecture. Therefore, a structure resembling that of the mediacative is to be achieved, including democratic and meritocratic requirements of legitimization.

### Areas of Accountability

In general, all powers and accountabilities of the central banks are to be included in the new power of state. In addition, several competencies of the legislative and the executive are to be subtracted and added to the monecative. This is due to the requirement that the decision-making process concerning financial issues must prevent lavishness among the parliamentarians, who are eager to improve their position against their own stakeholders, i.e. the people.

Therefore, additionally to the supervision of banks, the monecative must be authorized to supervise the financial expenses of the state in general, overseeing the state's budget, i.e. handling of tax income, especially the adequacy of tax law. Furthermore, the monecative is responsible for the prevention and detection of corruption in politics in particular.

Hence, the monecative discusses the financial decision-making with the legislative and the executive. In accordance with the federalistic structure, this overseeing authorization must be adjusted to the corresponding state level.

Further determinations must be made in consideration of the corresponding cultural values and norms, the customary laws and the people's expectations. In each case, the institutional implementation of the monecative is to be called the monetariate. The custodium (see section on Judicial) guarantees the compliance towards the CAT principle.

### Structure

#### Pecunium

The Pecunium constitutes the democratically legitimized chamber of the monetariate. Its primary duties are to represent citizens' financial interests, to set public-facing financial policy goals, and to provide democratic oversight of monetary and fiscal decisions.

Members of the pecunium are called "Pecunians"

##### Election

- Members (pecunians) are elected by voters using the Subject Election Principal (SEP).

##### Membership

- Limited to 5 members only



##### Powers

***Request Review***

- Can request finiance reports from the Aerarium and Union-Controlled financial institutions

***Monetary Policy***

- Can approve, reject, or debate monetary policy proposed by the Aerarium or Executive that affects their respective areas. (Aerarium can only propose policies which only affects the aerarium, Executive can only propose policies that affect the executive)
- Major budgets such as a yearly budget concerning the entire union must still be discussed with the Major Congress.

***Corruption Report***
- Can ignitiate an investigation on Union Politicians if corrution or legal breaches are suspected
- If needed, the custodium can be called at any time to support investigation.
- If a corruption report is done to a member(s) of the penuncum, then only the custodium is allowed to take actions.

##### Rules

1. Anonimous Actions
All actions taken by the penicium are anonmimized to avoid deliberate targeting of an individual for financial or political gain, along with prevetning corruption.
2. Shared Respondsibility
As a counter balence to "Anonimous Actions", all pecunians are respondsible for each others actions, both positive and negative. In essecanse, this means that everyone operates as the same entity to talk to.
3. Complete Neutrality
To become a candidate of the Pecunium, you must have neutral stance towards politics.
(Neutral can be defined, as not benefiting a particular group or individual, but to take in account all views and data and take the smartest action. This means call  - Aerarians are selected according to the SEP among qualified financial professionals, prioritizing candidates with supervisory or central-banking experience.
  - Panel sizes mirror the Pecunium with nAerarium = nPecunium - 1 (or as otherwise set by NLSP rules).
ing out when something is clearly stupid or mean't to benefit a group, even if unintentional. You can still have your own views and affliations but your actiosn must be neutral)
  - The Pecunium shall not perform day-to-day management of banks or execute monetary policy instruments reserved to the aerarium.
  - Decisions requiring technical central-banking operations are made in coordination with the aerarium and documented in public reports.

#### Aerarium

The Aerarium is the technocratic chamber of the monetariate, composed of members (aerarians) with banking, monetary policy, and financial supervision experience. Its role is operational stewardship of monetary instruments, bank supervision, and technical fiscal advice.

##### Elections

- Aerarians are chosen via the Subject Election Principal.
- The "voters" are those institutions or individuals who hold capital (money) and want to work with the Union.
- The "candidates" are proposed by the same capital holders, candidates get to choose what polices they support. 

***Candidate Requirements***
- Must have atleast taken a financial class and have presentable proof OR demonstrate enough knowledge in economics and/or financing.

##### Membership

- Limited to 4 members only

##### Rules
1. Must follow laws and orders from both the Pecunium
2. Must deliver at the very least a financial report every year.
3. Reports must be public, non-sensitive, and clear.
4. Where policy choices have distributive or democratic implications, the Aerarium negotiates with the Pecunium; final democratic mandates rest with the Pecunium while technical execution remains with the Aerarium.
5. Upon completion of project CyberNet (Part of Project Cybersyn) all banks represented by each Aerarium member must register to be part of cybernet. (This rule current is to be defined later)
